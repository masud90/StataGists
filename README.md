Reproducible Stata short hands

--------------------------------

This repository contains Stata shorthands for various types of econometric analysis.

Send me a pull request if you wish to contribute. 

--------------------------------
Pull request housekeeping:
1. Name variables and syntax using non-specific/generic variable names/ labels. For example: use foo, bar, or var1 etc. instead of Age, Sex, CarType.
2. Use comments as much as possible to make code legible.
3. Design do-file structures as standalone modules so that they can be used as plug-and-play, and called from a master do-file.
4. Declare local instead of global as often as possible.
